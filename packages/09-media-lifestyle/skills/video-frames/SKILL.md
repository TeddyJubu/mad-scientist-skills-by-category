Extract a single frame from a video, or create quick thumbnails for inspection.

## What This Skill Does

Extracts individual frames or short clips from any video file. Useful for creating thumbnails, extracting screenshots for social posts, or saving a specific moment.

## Quick start

First frame:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/frame.sh /path/to/video.mp4 --out /tmp/frame.jpg
```

At a timestamp:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/frame.sh /path/to/video.mp4 --time 00:00:10 --out /tmp/frame-10s.jpg
```

## Notes

- Prefer `--time` for “what is happening around here?”.
- Use a `.jpg` for quick share; use `.png` for crisp UI frames.
